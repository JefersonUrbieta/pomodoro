<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This application consists of a timer for Pomodoro technique.

The Pomodoro technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. 
The technique uses a timer to divide work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes long, separated by short intervals - 5 minutes.

The idea of ​​developing this application came from the video [More 80 ideas to learn to program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4CCPaYLTWg&t) by [Filipe Deschamps](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU5JicSrEM5A63jkJ2QvGYw) where the [App Ideas Collection](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) repository of [Florin Pop](https://github.com/florinpop17) was presented. 
I was very excited about the projects, because the ideas in it are very good for spending time programming.

Looking at more of the [Florin Pop](https://github.com/florinpop17) repositories I discovered this [100Days100Projects](https://github.com/florinpop17/100Days100Projects) and I felt challenged to embark on this challenge.
From then on, I started to develop some of the ideas from the [App Ideas Collection](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) repository in order to meet the challenge [100Days100Projects](https://github.com/florinpop17/100Days100Projects).

This project was developed on day 1 of the challenge #100Days100Projects

### Idea from App Ideas Collection

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks - 5 minutes.

#### User Stories

-   [ ] User can see a timer for 25 minutes - the **working** session
-   [ ] After the **working** session is over, the User can see a timer for 5 minutes - the **break** session
-   [ ] User can _start_ / _pause_, _stop_ and _reset_ the timers

#### Bonus features

-   [ ] User can hear a sound playing when the timer hits `00:00` - denoting that the session has ended
-   [ ] User can change / customize the minutes in both sessions before starting
-   [ ] User can set a **long break** session of 10 minutes. This will be activated every 4th **break** session
